<u><h2>The quadratic formula</h2></u>

 <p>
The famous quadratic formula, in some countries, like Brazil and France, called as the "Bháskhara Formula", 
<br>
has it origin in the XVII century.
It was created by a prodigiuos Indian mathematician, called <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bh%C4%81skara_II" target="_blank">Bhaskara Akaria</a>.
    <br>
His formula is actually really simple and it's not the only way to solve a second degree polynomial equation!
    <br>
But, here, we are going to learn how was it discovered, and what all the meanings of the things in a quadratic equation.

<u><h2>Demonstration</h2></u>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ax² + bx + c = 0
    <br>
    <br>
<strong> Divide both sides by a : </strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspax²/a + bx/a + c/a = 0/a
    <br>
    <br>
<strong> ax²/a = x² : </strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp² + bx/a + c/a = 0 
    <br>
    <br>
<strong> Add, b²/2a on both sides, so you can get the (a + b)² case : </strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp x² + (b/a)x + (b/2a)² - (b/2a)² - (b/2a)² + c/a = 0 
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (x + b/2a)² + (4ac/4a² - b²/4a) = 0 
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (x + b/2a)² = - (4ac/4a² - b²/4a)
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp x + b/2a = sqrt(b² - 4ac/4a²)
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp x = -b/2a ± sqrt(b² - 4ac/4a²)
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp x = -b/2a ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)/2a
    <br>
    <br>
<strong>Let (b² - 4ac) = Δ : </strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <strong> x = -b/2a ± sqrt(Δ)/2a </strong>
    <br>
    <br>
</div>

<div id="The discriminant">
<u><h2>The discriminant</h2></u>

 <p>
The value of the discriminant Δ has a meaningful paper in a quadratic equation.
The value of the discriminant can tell if the function has 0, 1 or 2 real roots!
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
<li> If b² - 4ac is a positive real nuymber, the function has 2 real roots.</li>
<li> If b² - 4ac is equal to 0, so the funtion has 2 equal real roots, or, just one real root. </li>
<li>If b² - 4ac is equal to a negative real number, so the funtion has no real roots, once there isn't in the real numbers, a square root of a negative number.</li>
    </ul>

<div id="The 'a' coefficient">
<u><h2>The 'a' coefficient</h2></u>

 <p>
The value that is multiplying the x² in a quadratic formula is called 'a coefficient', and determines the slope of the parabola.
    <br>
So, for bigger values of 'a' the parabola is more "closed" than for smaller values. So then, for bigger values, the slope of the 
    <br>
parabola is bigger than for smaller values!
    <br>
    <br>
In the example below, I used GeoGebra to create two different (ax²) functions. The first has 'a' = 1, and the second has 'a' = 10:
    <br>
    <br>
&nbsp &nbsp <img src = "C:\Users\marco\Pictures\Print\Capturar 34.PNG" alt = 'The parabola of the equation: f(x) = x²'>

    <br>
&nbsp &nbsp <a href = "https://www.geogebra.org/" target = "_blank"><img src = "C:\Users\marco\Pictures\Print\Capturar 35.PNG" alt = 'The parabola of the equation: f(x) = 10x²'></a>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
*Note that the slope of the [f(x) = 10x²] equation is much bigger than the [f(x) = x²], just because the 'a' coefficient is much bigger!
    <br>
    <br>

<div id="Conclusion A">
<u><h3>Conclusion</h3></u>

 <p>
We can conclude about the 'a' coefficient that:
    <ol>
        <li>It's the value that multiplies the x² on a quadratic.</li>
        <li>It determines the slope of the parabola.</li>
        <li>If it's equal to 0, there is no quadratic equation.</li>
    </ol>
 </p>

</div>

<div id ="The 'b' coefficient">
<u><h2>The 'b' coefficient</h2></u>

 <p>
The value that is multiplying the x in a quadratic formula is called 'b coefficient', and represents the angular coefficient of the the linear equation that tangents the parabola in (x=0).
    <br>
Using the image below to ilustrate it, we can see that the linear equation that tangents the function [f(x) = ax² + bx + c] is:
    <br>
    <br>
<strong> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp f(x) = bx + c </strong>
    <br>
    <br>
&nbsp &nbsp <a href = "https://www.geogebra.org/" target = "_blank"> <img src = "C:\Users\marco\Pictures\Print\Capturar 36.PNG" alt = "The 'b' coefficient on a quadratic equation. Image created using GeoGebra."> </a>
<br>
<br>
In the image above, I used GeoGebra to construct the tangent linear equation, using b and c, as the coefficient. It ilustrates what I said later!
 </p>

</div>

<div id="Conclusion B">
<u><h3>Conclusion</h3></u>
 
<p>

We can conclude about the 'b' coefficient that:
    <ol>
        <li>It's the value that multiplies x in the quadratic.</li>
        <li>It determines the angular coefficient of the tangent linear equation of a quadratic.</li>
    </ol>

 </p>

</div>

<div id = "The 'c' coefficient">
<u><h2>The 'c' coefficient</h2></u>    

 <p>
The value that isn't multiplying anything in a quadratic formula is called 'c coefficient', and determines where,
in the Y axis, the parabola will touch.
    <br>
It happens, because:
    <br>
    <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp f(0) = (0 * a) + (0 * b) + c
    <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp => f(0) = c
    <br>
    <br>
So: when x = 0, f(x) = c.
    <br>

</p>

</div>

<div id = "Conclusion C">
<u><h3>Conclusion</h3></u>


 <p>
We can conclude about the 'c' coefficient that:
 </p>

<ol>
    <li>It's the value that doesn't multiplies x in the quadratic.</li>
    <li>It determines where will the parabola touch the y axis.</li>
    <li>If there is no 'c' coefficient, then the parabola will touch the y axis in the origin (0,0) </li>
</ol>
